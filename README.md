## üìÇ Projects Overview

### 1. CycleGAN ‚Äì Human ‚Üî Animal Style Transfer
**Objective:** Train a CycleGAN model to transfer images between human faces and cats/dogs.

**Key Features:**
- Trained using UTK Face, InceptionV3 (human faces), Dog Face, and Cat datasets.
- Generated visually plausible stylized images using CycleGAN.
- Adjustable hyperparameters for improved training and reduced overfitting.

**Notebook:** [CycleGAN Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IBqrzfUyAd6SO7HiPCIiZaAxXeAFqXEk)  
**Dataset References:**
